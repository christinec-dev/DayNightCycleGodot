# Godot 2D Day & Night Cycle
This is the official GitHub repository for the shader-based Day & Night Cycle, featured on my YouTube channel. This system incorporates shader-based shadows, dynamic light rays, and an AnimationPlayer-based day and night cycle. ðŸ˜Š

## Features
### Daytime Dependent Shadows
- `Dynamic Adjustment`: Shadows adjust their angle, length, and color based on the time of day.
- `Wide Applicability`: Implement shadows across various game objects using Godotâ€™s LightOccluder nodes.

### Daytime Dependent Light Rays
- `Visual Dynamics`: Light rays animate and change color according to the time of day.
- `Customizable Effects`: Easily adjust the size, separation, angle, and position of the light rays to fit the needs of your scene.
  
### Animated Day/Night Cycle
- `Sky Modulation`: Utilizes ColorModulate and AnimationPlayers to shift the skyâ€™s color in synchronization with the time of day, simulating realistic day-to-night transitions.
